# learning-redux-flow-jest
To learn more about Flow and Redux I want to program a ToDo-App tested with Jest.

# Steps:

1. Setup create-react-app, Flow and Flow-Typed(https://stephenmann.io/post/how-to-setup-flow-with-create-react-app-and-visual-studio-code/)
2. Added eslint (airbnb style)
3. Added functionality with common React state model
4. Installed redux and changed App to use Redux

## Requirements

* for watch commands: **fswatch** (`brew install fswatch`)
